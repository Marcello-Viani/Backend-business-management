“Enterprise-style backend API built with Spring Boot

This project is a backend REST API designed to simulate a real-world enterprise management system.
It focuses on backend development best practices, clean architecture, and secure API design.

The application is intended as a professional portfolio project and as a practical application of the knowledge acquired during the Multiplatform Application Development (DAM) program."

The main goals of this project are:

- Apply backend development concepts in a real-world scenario
- Design a clean and maintainable backend architecture
- Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Follow industry best practices for scalability and code quality
- Build a solid backend project suitable for a professional portfolio

The project is being developed using the following technologies:

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security
- PostgreSQL
- Git & GitHub

The backend follows a layered architecture, separating responsibilities into well-defined layers:

- Controller layer
- Service layer
- Repository layer
- Model (Entity) layer
- This structure improves maintainability, testability, and scalability.

This project is currently under active development.
New features and improvements are added incrementally as part of a learning-oriented and professional workflow.
